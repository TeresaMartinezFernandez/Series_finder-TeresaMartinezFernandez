# Series browser

The purpose of this project is to build a series browser, which can display a list with the result of the search and another list with the favourite series. I ran a fetch request to pull information from an API. By clicking on the Search button, the application must connect to the TVMaze open API for series search.This second list gets created once you click on each card of the main list, and the information is saved on local storage. In order to populate my data base.

The exercise is done with HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. To start the page from Visual Code open with Live Server.

Some of the strings returned by the API do not have an image. In that case, a filling image is shown with the placeholder.com service where in the URL itself we indicate the size, colors, text: https://via.placeholder.com/210x295/ffffff/666666/? text = TV.
Favorites: Once the search results appear, the user can indicate which are our favorite series. To do this, clicking on any series is shown in the list on the left of favorite series.

We can delete the entire list of favorites by clicking the delete button.
